# TDI milestone project
This project ties together some important concepts and
technologies from the 12-day TDI course, including Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas,
Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization.

The repository contains a basic template for a Flask configuration that will
work on Heroku (adopted from [flask-framework](https://github.com/thedataincubator/flask-framework)).
